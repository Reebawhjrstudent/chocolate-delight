Whenever we feel down or when we are not in a good mood, we turn to chocolate cake as our comfort food. The main ingredient of the chocolate in this cake is cocoa, which helps our brain release endorphins or the “feel good” chemical. This is why whenever we eat this cake, our moods lighten and we feel a lot better.

Cream and Chocolate all over the Cake Outside and chocolate cream Inside. Freshly made Chocolate Delight Cake with melted chocolate inside is everyone's favorite.

Step 1
Preheat oven to 140Â°C. Position a rack on the second lowest shelf of the oven. Brush a round 25cm (base measurement) cake pan with the melted butter to lightly grease. Line base and sides with non-stick baking paper.

Step 2
Place the self-raising flour, plain flour, cocoa, bicarbonate of soda sugar, butter, milk and eggs in a large mixing bowl. Use an electric beater to beat on low speed for 30 seconds or until just combined. Increase the speed to high and beat for 1-2 minutes or until the mixture is thick and all the butter is incorporated. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the surface with the back of a spoon.

Step 3
Bake in preheated oven for 2 1/2 hours or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Remove from oven and set aside for 10 minutes. Turn onto a wire rack for 2 hours or until completely cool.

Step 4
Meanwhile make icing: Place the butter in a large mixing bowl. Use an electric beater to beat for 2 minutes or until very light and fluffy.

Step 5
Gradually add the icing sugar and beat until the mixture is very pale and fluffy. Gradually add the melted chocolate and beat until smooth and well combined.

Step 6
To assemble the cake, trim the top to even the surface. Split cake horizontally into 3 even layers. Invert top layer on a cake stand.

Step 7
Spread a 1cm-thick layer of icing over the cake layer. Repeat with the remaining cake and icing, finishing with a cake layer.

Step 8
Use a spatula to spread the remaining icing over the top and sides of the cake. Smooth the icing, then using the tip of the spatula or a knife, make large swirls in the icing on the top of the cake.

Step 9
Attach double-sided tape along centre back of 2.5cm-wide satin ribbon. Press waxed paper onto tape. Place more tape along back of organza ribbon. Attach to front of satin ribbon. Place more tape along back of 1cm-wide satin ribbon. Attach to organza ribbon.

Step 10
Place the ribbon around the cake and press gently to attach. Trim the ends to join neatly at the back. Decorate with candles.
